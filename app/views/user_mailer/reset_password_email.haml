    Hi #{@name},
%pre
    Someone recently requested a password change for your BookStore account.
    If this was you, you can set a new password #{link_to "here", password_recovery_url(:id=>@token)}.

    If you don't want to change your password or didn't request this, 
    just ignore and delete this message.
